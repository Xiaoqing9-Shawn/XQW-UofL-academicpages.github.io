XIAOQING WANG,. Ph.D.
======
I am a postdoc in the department of pharmacology and toxicology at the University of Louisville (https://louisville.edu/).
I was honored to receive the Special Prize of the President Scholarship of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), which is the highest honor for students in CAS, and the Junior Investigator Award from the Research Society on Alcoholism (RSA) (USA).
My academic training and research experience have provided me with an excellent background in multiple disciplines including molecular biology, biochemistry, molecular toxicology, computational toxicology, aquatic biology, artificial intelligence machine learning, and deep learning.
My major research focuses on characterizing mechanisms via cell-based assays and biologically informed artificial intelligence (machine learning and deep learning) models. My current research has focused on identifying and validating biomarkers for the prevention of Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD).
I currently serve as a co-I in a pilot grant that aims to identify epigenetic targets for nutrient intervention of FASD using artificial intelligence and gene editing technologies.
Overall, I have published 11 peer-reviewed journals as the first author, 5 co-author publications, and I also have one granted patent as the first author and the co-author of three monographs.

In addition to the research works described above, I have also established high-performance computing server platforms and improved new modeling methods for toxicity prediction. Additionally, I actively assisted my supervisor in writing grant proposals. Moreover, I also led and coordinated with others from different disciplines to construct two database platforms and web pages, such as Marine Ecotoxicology Databases and Nanotoxicity Databases.
